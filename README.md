# cse111_Project
**(under construction)**
    Purpose: Design and implement a tiered data management application consisting of an interface for interacting with the user and a back-end database for storing and retrieving the data. The user should have the capability to visualize the data in the database, add new data, delete, and update existing data. Extracting statistics and reports from the database is a feature that you should also consider.  (taken from project description)
